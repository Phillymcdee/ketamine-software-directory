    "content": "**Overview** This comparison contrasts Charm Health, a general healthcare EHR with AI features and a free tier, against CliniFusion, a ketamine-specific EMR designed by anesthesiologists for IV infusion clinics. It's essentially a choice between adapting a flexible general platform versus using purpose-built ketamine software.\n\n**Key Differences**\n• Ketamine protocol support: CliniFusion offers comprehensive IV and IM protocols plus series tracking, while Charm Health lacks ketamine-specific protocols and relies on general templates\n• Target audience: CliniFusion focuses on anesthesiologist-run infusion clinics with vital signs integration, while Charm Health serves general mental health practices with psychiatry templates\n• Pricing transparency: Charm Health offers a free tier with per-clinician pricing, while CliniFusion requires custom quotes with undisclosed pricing\n• Platform status: Charm Health is actively developed with AI scribe features, but CliniFusion shows concerning signs with an expired SSL certificate and uncertain operational status\n\n**Best For** Charm Health suits budget-conscious mental health practices wanting a customizable EHR with AI documentation assistance and don't require specialized ketamine protocols. CliniFusion is designed for IV ketamine clinics run by anesthesiologists who need integrated vital signs monitoring and standardized infusion protocols, though potential users should verify the company's current operational status given the website security issues.\n\n**Bottom Line** Choose Charm Health for cost-effective general mental health practice management with ketamine outcome tracking capabilities, or CliniFusion for specialized IV infusion clinic operations—but investigate CliniFusion's current status before committing due to apparent website and support concerns.",

  "charm-vs-drchrono": {
    "content": "**Overview** This comparison examines two general EHR platforms that serve mental health practices but lack specialized ketamine treatment features. Charm Health offers a budget-friendly option with AI assistance and basic outcome tracking, while DrChrono provides a mobile-first platform with comprehensive practice management tools.\n\n**Key Differences**\n• Ketamine support: Charm Health includes outcome tracking and rating scales for mental health monitoring, while DrChrono offers no ketamine-specific features whatsoever\n• Pricing transparency: Charm Health provides clear per-clinician pricing with a free tier option, whereas DrChrono requires contacting sales for custom quotes\n• AI capabilities: Charm Health includes AI scribe functionality to reduce documentation time, while DrChrono focuses on mobile accessibility and API integrations\n• Mental health focus: Charm Health offers psychiatry-specific templates, while DrChrono serves 30+ specialties with general mental health support\n\n**Best For** \nCharm Health works best for budget-conscious ketamine clinics that need basic outcome tracking and rating scales, especially solo practitioners or small practices wanting to minimize costs while maintaining customization options. DrChrono suits established multi-specialty practices that prioritize mobile access and need robust billing capabilities, particularly those with technical resources to leverage API integrations for custom workflows.\n\n**Bottom Line** Neither platform offers dedicated ketamine treatment protocols or specialized features like consent forms or series tracking that ketamine clinics typically need. Practices should consider Charm Health for cost savings and basic mental health tracking, or DrChrono for comprehensive practice management with mobile functionality, but both will likely require significant customization to meet ketamine-specific workflow requirements.",
