        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The ketamine and psychedelic therapy industry is growing rapidly, but finding the right software to run your clinic shouldn't be complicated. We created this directory to help clinic owners and administrators make informed decisions about EHR, practice management, and billing software.
        </p>

        <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike general healthcare software directories, we evaluate every solution specifically for ketamine and psychedelic therapy workflows. We look at features that matter to your practice:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>IV and IM ketamine protocol templates</li>
          <li>SPRAVATO® REMS compliance workflows</li>
          <li>Patient outcome tracking and rating scales</li>
          <li>Treatment series management</li>
          <li>Ketamine-specific consent forms</li>
          <li>ePrescribing for controlled substances</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Review Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          For each software in our directory, we:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Research official sources</strong> - We start with vendor websites, documentation, and pricing pages</li>
          <li><strong>Analyze user reviews</strong> - We aggregate feedback from Capterra, G2, GetApp, and other trusted review platforms</li>
          <li><strong>Verify pricing</strong> - We confirm pricing whenever possible and note when "contact for pricing" is required</li>
          <li><strong>Evaluate ketamine features</strong> - We specifically assess each solution's ketamine and psychedelic therapy capabilities</li>
          <li><strong>Update regularly</strong> - We verify information quarterly and note the last verification date on each listing</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Independence & Transparency</h2>
        <p>
          We maintain editorial independence. Our reviews and rankings are based on features, pricing, and user feedback—not advertising dollars. When we have affiliate relationships with vendors, we disclose them clearly.
        </p>
